This casperJS script can be used to scrape and backup contents of a wiki page on Russian social networking site vk.com. 

The script logs you into the network, goes to the address of the wiki-page, enters 'wiki edit' mode and saves the contents of the page together with the wiki markup code into a text file.

I wrote the script because the vk API doesn't have any options to save the contents of a wiki page, it only has methods to work with regular posts. Hopefully someone will find the script useful and will build up on it.
